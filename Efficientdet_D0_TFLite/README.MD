* I created code to perform object detection inference on pedestrians using the pre-trained `efficientdet_d1_coco17_tpu-32` model from the TensorFlow Object Detection API Model Zoo and visualized the results.

* However, I attempted to convert this pre-trained `efficientdet_d1_coco17_tpu-32` model from the TensorFlow Object Detection API Model Zoo to a TensorFlow Lite version, but the conversion was unsuccessful.
